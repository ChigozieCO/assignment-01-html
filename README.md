# First Semester Assignment 1

This is the first assignment for the AltSchool School of Engineering Tinyuka semester being the first semester. 

## Assignment Details

Write out the HTML for 2 pages linked together that is accessible, it should use the anchor tag to create a good global navigation.

**Page 1**: An about me page with details including your personal details, reasons for joining AltSchool, and what you plan to achieve with AltSchool.

**Page 2**: Replicate the [AltSchool form](https://portal.altschoolafrica.com/auth/create-account) you filled out while you registered for AltSchool.

## Solution

This is a simple HTML assignment, we were asked to write out just the HTML code for these pages and so this repo contains my html code for the two page and the favicon assets.

While my solution code lives in this repo, the site is hosted [here](https://65770a803fed5a7364de7a7a--monumental-axolotl-4a4417.netlify.app/).
